# Flatpak PyInstaller Fix

## Issue Resolution

### Problem
The Flatpak build was failing because it was trying to download PyQt6 and other Python dependencies from the internet during the Flatpak build process, but the Flatpak build environment doesn't have internet access.

Error:
```
WARNING: Retrying after connection broken by 'NewConnectionError'
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement PyQt6
ERROR: No matching distribution found for PyQt6
```

### Root Cause
The Flatpak manifest was trying to install Python dependencies inside the sandboxed Flatpak build environment, but:
1. Flatpak build environments don't have internet access by default
2. The application is already pre-compiled with PyInstaller and doesn't need separate Python dependencies

### Solution Applied
Changed the approach to match your existing RPM build process:

1. **Build PyInstaller executable in GitHub Actions** (where internet access is available)
2. **Package the pre-built executable in Flatpak** (no Python dependencies needed)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Workflow (`.github/workflows/flatpak_build.yml`)

**Added PyInstaller build step:**
```yaml
- name: Install Python dependencies and build executable
  run: |
    cd rpmbuild/SOURCES
    pip3 install PyInstaller PyQt6 PyYAML Pillow
    
    # Build the standalone executable using PyInstaller
    pyinstaller log_viewer.spec
    
    # Verify executable was created
    ls -la dist/
```

### 2. Updated Manifest (`com.michettetech.LogViewer.yaml`)

**Before (Failed):**
```yaml
modules:
  - name: python3-dependencies
    build-commands:
      - pip3 install PyQt6>=6.4.0 PyYAML>=6.0 Pillow>=9.0.0  # ❌ No internet access
    
  - name: logviewer
    build-commands:
      - install -Dm755 rpmbuild/SOURCES/log_viewer.py ...      # ❌ Raw Python script
```

**After (Working):**
```yaml
modules:
  - name: logviewer
    build-commands:
      - install -Dm755 rpmbuild/SOURCES/dist/log_viewer ...    # ✅ Pre-built executable
```

### 3. Updated Desktop Entry

**Changed command:**
```diff
- Exec=log_viewer.py %F    # ❌ Python script
+ Exec=log_viewer %F       # ✅ Executable binary
```

### 4. Updated App Command

**Changed manifest command:**
```diff
- command: log_viewer.py   # ❌ Python script
+ command: log_viewer      # ✅ Executable binary
```

## How It Works Now

1. **GitHub Actions builds the executable:**
   - Installs Python dependencies (with internet access)
   - Runs PyInstaller to create standalone `log_viewer` binary
   - Binary includes all Python dependencies bundled

2. **Flatpak packages the executable:**
   - No Python installation needed
   - No internet access required
   - Just packages the pre-built binary and supporting files

3. **User runs Flatpak:**
   - Executes the standalone binary directly
   - All dependencies are already bundled inside the executable

## Benefits

- ✅ **No internet dependency** during Flatpak build
- ✅ **Consistent with RPM approach** (both use PyInstaller)
- ✅ **Smaller Flatpak size** (no duplicate Python runtime)
- ✅ **Better performance** (native executable vs interpreted Python)
- ✅ **Simpler manifest** (no complex dependency management)

## Expected Results

The next build should:
1. ✅ Build the PyInstaller executable successfully (with internet access)
2. ✅ Package the executable in Flatpak (without internet access)
3. ✅ Create a working `.flatpak` bundle
4. ✅ Complete without dependency resolution errors

This approach mirrors your successful RPM build process and eliminates the internet connectivity issues in the Flatpak build environment.
