================= ANSI COLOR TESTING INSTRUCTIONS =================

To test ANSI color processing in Log Viewer:

1. Open Log Viewer:
   cd /home/travis/Github/log_viewer/rpmbuild/SOURCES
   python log_viewer.py

2. Test Files Created:
   - ANSI_TEST_LOG.log (comprehensive test with all color codes)
   - SIMPLE_COLOR_TEST.log (basic red/green/yellow/blue test)

3. Testing Steps:
   a) Open one of the test files using "Open Log File" button
   
   b) Check if ANSI processing is enabled:
      - Go to View menu → "ANSI Color Processing" 
      - Should be checked (✓) by default
      
   c) Expected Results with ANSI enabled:
      - Lines with [31m should show RED text
      - Lines with [32m should show GREEN text  
      - Lines with [33m should show YELLOW text
      - Lines with [1m should show BOLD text
      - Lines should NOT show the [31m codes themselves
      
   d) Test toggling:
      - Uncheck "ANSI Color Processing" in View menu
      - File should reload showing plain text without color codes
      - Re-check to enable colors again

4. What to look for:
   - WORKING: Text appears in colors, no [31m codes visible
   - NOT WORKING: You see [31m codes as text, no colors
   - BROKEN: Black/white blocks instead of text

5. Test Unicode cleaning:
   - Open ANSI_TEST_LOG.log
   - Look for "ansible-galaxy" line (should not have weird characters)
   - Should show clean "ansible-galaxy" not "ansible‪-galaxy"

If colors don't appear, try:
- Toggle ANSI processing off/on via View menu
- Check that View → ANSI Color Processing has a checkmark
- Try different test files
- Check console output for error messages
